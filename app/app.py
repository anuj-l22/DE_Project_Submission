    Welcome to the **Gold Price Prediction Dashboard**! This tool leverages machine learning to forecast gold prices by 
    considering the impact of various global events, such as economic policies, natural disasters, and geopolitical crises. 
    By analyzing patterns in historical data, the model generates insights to help predict future price trends.

    This project uses a combination of historical gold prices and event data collected over years. Key features include:
    
    - **Date**: Daily gold prices covering a substantial historical period.
    - **Price Information**: Open, high, low, close prices of gold each day.
    - **Event Data**: Significant world events categorized by types (Economic Policy Change, War, Natural Disaster, etc.).
    - **Event Encoding**: Events are encoded based on their type and impact, helping the model understand patterns.
    
    The dataset is structured to capture how global events influence gold prices, providing the foundation for accurate forecasting.

        Our machine learning model employs time series analysis techniques, using historical gold prices and event-related data to 
        make accurate predictions. The model has been trained to recognize how different types of events impact price trends, 
        allowing it to adapt and improve with each prediction.

    **Prediction Steps**:
    1. **Historical Data Analysis**: Patterns in past data are identified, especially during event-driven fluctuations.
    2. **Event Encoding**: Events are categorized and encoded, giving the model a structure to assess likely impacts.
    3. **Trend Forecasting**: Using these insights, the model forecasts future price trends based on the specified event and forecast duration.
